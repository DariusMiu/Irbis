```Change Log (new changes since 0.1.2.0) ```
`01.` Completely overhauled the Camera system (somewhat still in progress)
`02.` All menu titles now in HIGH DEF (smooth lines!)
`03.` Player collider now rounds properly (numbers 17.5-18.5 round to 18 rather than numbers 18-19 rounding to 18)
`04.` Fixed rounding in player collision (it wasn't rounding at all)
`05.` Fixed some scaling bugs with new camera system
`06.` Game should now automatically start in windowed fullscreen mode
`07.` Fixed minor bug in collision (stemmed from changing positional rounding)
`08.` Collision will now automatically push the play out of collided objects, should they get stuck

```Known Bug List ```
`01.` Backgrounds don't seem to center properly when screenscale is over 2
`02.` Most menus are completely and totally broken.
`03.` Shield bar overlay texture (when holding Q) looks broken (the texture just isn't the right size)
