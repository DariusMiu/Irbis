###### Build Version: `0.2.1.8` | --  


## Known Bug List  
`00.` Replace current options implementation with if-less options implementation  
`01.` ~~Multithreading breaks down when too many enemies are being updated~~  
`02.` Vending Machine menu still slows the game down a lot (~30%) I think this is due to the transparency  
`03.` Camera swing causes weird things and has been disabled for the time being  
`04.` Player death causes freeze with multithreading (multithreading will get completely reworked in the future)  
`05.` Player sometimes get stuck in the falling animation despite having touched the ground  
`06.` ~~Standing on the lizard after roll attack makes the player clip through the wall and fall through the floor~~  
`07.` The player is able to push generic enemies around instead of vice-a-versa  
`08.` Slam doesn't work on Wizard  
`09.` Sometimes the stun animation will get stuck on only a single frame (seems to only happen when hit while running)
