``` Known Bug List  ```
`01.` Multithreading breaks down when too many enemies are being updated. (off by default)  
`02.` Vending Machine menu still slows the game down a lot (~30%) I think this is due to the transparency  
`03.` Camera swing has been disabled until a fix is found  


``` Notes  ```
`01.` Try out C0B0! Our first boss!
`02.` C0O0 is a test level. There is no content there, only an extremely early version of a 'survival mode'  
`03.` Keep in mind that you can wall jump in this game.
