```Change Log (new changes since 0.1.4.0) ```
`01.` Background textures now center properly  
`02.` Screenscale is not saved if it is automatically generated (so that if you change window size it doesn't use the larger scale)  
`03.` Vending Machine only uses one texture for the background instead of four (slightly more efficient)  
`04.` New bars mocked up  
`05.` New bars implemented  
`06.` New logo  
`07.` Added Lizard Boss (control with O and P)  
`08.` Collision updated to work properly with moving objects  
`09.` Updated player animation system  
`10.` Updated player spritesheet  
`11.` Improved debugging modes  
`12.` Fixed camera shake  
`13.` Other minor changes  


```Known Bug List ```
`01.` Background textures aren't centered properly (top left corner of the texture is in the center of the screen)  
`02.` Multithreading breaks down when too many enemies are being updated. (off by default)  
`03.` Vending Machine menu still slows the game down a lot (~30%) I think this is due to the transparency  
`04.` Camera swing has been disabled until a fix is found
