## Build Version: 0.2.0.4  
## | Beta!!  


### Known Bug List  
`01.` Multithreading breaks down when too many enemies are being updated. (off by default)  
`02.` Vending Machine menu still slows the game down a lot (~30%) I think this is due to the transparency  
`03.` Camera swing causes weird things and has been disabled for the time being  
`04.` Boss strike attack during bury phase sometimes hits twice  
`05.` Tailwhip and strike seem to not trigger their knockbacks occasionally  


### Important Notes  
`01.` Try out C0B0! Our first boss!  
`02.` C0O0 is a test level. There is no content there, only an extremely early version of a 'survival mode'  
`03.` Keep in mind that you can wall jump in this game.  
`04.` There is no death screen (yet!)  
`05.` Some animations are missing. The lizard boss has none, and only uses concept art. And the player is missing attack and roll animations.
